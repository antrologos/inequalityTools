\title{Computes the Growth Appropriation between two periods for equal-sized income strata/bins}
\usage{
growthAppr_byStrata(
  x0,
  x1,
  n_strata = 10,
  w0 = NULL,
  w1 = NULL,
  correct_for_negativeGrowth = T
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x0}{A vector of incomes at time 0}

\item{x1}{A vector of incomes at time 1}

\item{n_strata}{A numeric value indicating how many bins will be created}

\item{w0}{(optional) A vector of sample weights at time 0}

\item{w1}{(optional) A vector of sample weights at time 1}

\item{correct_for_negativeGrowth}{A logical value. Correct for negative growth. Default to TRUE.}
}
\value{
Returns a tibble with the following columns:
    - Strata: Number of the ordered income strata
    - Pop. Share: Population share at the strata
    - Mean 0: Mean income of the strata at time 0
    - Mean 1: Mean income of the strata at time 1
    - Growth Appropriation: Growth appropriation of the strata between times 0 and 1
