\arguments{
\item{x0}{A vector of incomes for group/time 0}

\item{x1}{A vector of incomes for group/time 1}

\item{w0}{(optional) A vector of sample weights for group/time 0}

\item{w1}{(optional) A vector of sample weights for group/time 1}

\item{correct_for_negativeGrowth}{A logical value. Correct for negative growth. Default to TRUE.}

\item{gridIntegration}{(optional) A grid of class 'NIGrid' for multivariate numerical integration (mvQuad package)}
}
\value{
Returns a function which takes a vector of probabilities as inputs (p) and gives points at the Growth Appropriation Curve as outputs
