  qf1,
  correct_for_negativeGrowth = T,
  gridIntegration = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{qf0}{A quantile function for group/time 0}

\item{qf1}{A quantile function for group/time 1}

\item{correct_for_negativeGrowth}{A logical value. Correct for negative growth. Default to TRUE.}

\item{gridIntegration}{(optional) A grid of class 'NIGrid' for multivariate numerical integration (mvQuad package)}
}
\value{
Returns a function which takes a vector of probabilities as inputs (p) and gives points at the Growth Appropriation Curve as outputs
}
