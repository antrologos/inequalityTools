\usage{
make_growthConcCurve(
  x0,
  x1,
  w0 = NULL,
  w1 = NULL,
  correct_for_negativeGrowth = T,
  gridIntegration = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x0}{A vector of incomes for group/time 0}

\item{x1}{A vector of incomes for group/time 1}

\item{w0}{(optional) A vector of sample weights for group/time 0}

\item{w1}{(optional) A vector of sample weights for group/time 1}

\item{correct_for_negativeGrowth}{A logical value. Correct for negative growth. Default to TRUE.}

\item{gridIntegration}{(optional) A grid of class 'NIGrid' for multivariate numerical integration (mvQuad package)}
}
\value{
Returns a function which takes a vector of probabilities as inputs (p) and gives points at the Growth Concentration Curve as outputs
}
